# Challenge12- This challenge identifies various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. We will be using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Step 1: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Step 2: Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Step 3: Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
Step 4: Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
