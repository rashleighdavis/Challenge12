Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

The purpose of this analysis was to train and evaluate models with different sets of data to determine which model was the most accurate in identifying the credit worthiness of a customer.
The financial information that was provided was typical lending infomation such as: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, numbner of accounts, derogatory remarks, total debt amd loan status. Based on this information the models were trying to predict the crediditworthiness of a customer; with highest accuracy, most of the time. 

The variable were the if the loan was "healty" or "risky". The lending data was what contributed to these predicitons. The resampling method seemed to be 

Results:

Machine Learning Model 1:

Balanced: 95.2%
Precision: 85%
Recall: 91%
f1 score: 88%
 

Machine Learning Model 2:
    
Accuracy: 99.4%
Presision: 99%
Recall: 99%
f1 score: 91%

Balanced accuracy score: 99.4%
Precision score: 84%
Recall score: 99%
f1 score: 91%

Summary:

The oversampled model, which is model 2 seems to perform the best. This is shown by the improved accuracy and f1 scores. It is more important to predict the 1's because those are the riskier loans. 
I would recommend the oversampling model because it performed to an average of 99% which is very good.
